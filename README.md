## Project Idea

#### This project is made for recruitment on Front-End Developer position.

The first time I read the recruitment task I thought the task would be easy. However, after implementing more elements using redux-form(which I didn't know before) I had to check the documentation very often. In the end I am delighted with my solution, because I took into account all the assumptions and added something from myself.
